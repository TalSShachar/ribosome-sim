# Things left:

* Write essay
* Accept DNA sequence from the user at program start (By default use the Insulin, note that other DNA sequences might fail as the pre-mRNA splicing algorithm is very heuristic and prone for failure in exotic inputs)
* Fail while iterating in the simulation when getting to the end of the mRNA chain when an error happened while translating the chain (Due to the nonsense-mediated-decay)
* Fix simulation with spacings and try to make it Shimon-esque


For now that is all.
